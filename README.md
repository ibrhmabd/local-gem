# Local Gem 💎

Local Gem is a web app that delivers a few curated “hidden gem” recommendations provided by locals for those visiting the area. This repository contains a product management presentation analyzing consumer needs, competitors, and marketing strategies, along with a supporting demo web app that lets users enter a city and view interactive recommendation cards. Each card flips on hover to ask if the user has visited the spot, with 👍/👎 buttons and a Google Maps link.

## Features

- Hover-flip cards with built-in rating and map links
